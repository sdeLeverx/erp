# ERP

ERP is an application implemented using SAP CAP, SAP HANA integrating with Java/Spring Boot.

## Running project locally

Use the package manager [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to run locally.

```bash
# maven
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Open local application

http://localhost:8080

http://localhost:8080/api/EmployeeService/Employee

http://localhost:8080/api/EmployeeService/Device

## SAP HANA

After providing SAP HANA Cloud instance, add cds-feature-hana dependency and configure the file .cdsrc.json in the root folder.

```bash
{
  "hana" : {
    "deploy-format": "hdbtable"
  }
}
```

Implicitly push all artifacts to the database.

```bash
cds deploy --to hana:erp-hana --store-credentials
```

## Deploying it to CF

Run the following command to configure which Cloud Foundry environment you want to connect to in the terminal.

```bash
cf api <CF_API_ENDPOINT>

cf login
```

To deploy project into Cloud Foundry created a application manifest and enabled application for Cloud Foundry.

```bash
mvn clean install

cf push

cf apps
```

## XSUAA for local

While enabling application for Cloud Foundry by adding the cds-starter-cloudfoundry dependency it enabled CAP Javaâ€™s secure-by-default behaviour based on Spring Security. Now we should add some custom mock users to the application via adding the security section to the application.yaml file.

```bash
  security:
    mock:
      users:
        - name: admin
          password: admin
          roles:
            - admin
```

## XSUAA for Cloud Foundry

First we should generate security descriptor.

```bash
cds compile srv/ --to xsuaa > xs-security.json
```

Update application manifest.

```bash
---
applications:
  - name: erp
    path: srv/target/erp-exec.jar
    random-route: true
    buildpacks:
      - java_buildpack
    env:
      JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE: '{ jre: { version: 17.+ }}'
      JBP_CONFIG_SPRING_AUTO_RECONFIGURATION: '{enabled: false}'
      SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: cloud
    services:
      - erp-hana
      - erp-xsuaa
      - erp-logs
```

Then, create instance of the Authorization and Trust Management Service

```bash
cf create-service xsuaa application orders-xsuaa -c security/xs-security.json
```

In order to get environment variables for OAuth 2.0, we shoould run following command:

```bash
cf env erp
```

## Logging service

```bash
cf create-service application-logs lite erp-logs

cf bind-service erp erp-logs
```

## Remote debugging

Add below property in your manifest.yaml:

```bash
JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_OPTS: "[java_opts: '-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n,onjcmd=y']"
env:
  JBP_CONFIG_SAP_MACHINE_JDK: "[default_debug_agent_active: true]"
```

Restage your application:

```bash
cf restage erp
```

After successfully navigating to space, you need to enable the ssh-tunnel for the application you want to debug. Just to be sure, run the below command to see whether ssh is enabled for your application or not. 

```bash
cf enable-ssh erp
cf ssh-enabled erp
cf ssh erp
```

Move to 'bin' directory:

```bash
cd app/META-INF/.sap_java_buildpack/sap_machine_jdk/bin
```

Run the following command to found $JAVA_PID of debug process:
'META-INF/.sap_java_buildpack/sap_machine_jdk/bin/java'

```bash
ps aux
exit
```

Start the debug process. Replace $JAVA_PID on your number, and <app_name>:

```bash
cf ssh erp -c "export JAVA_PID=ps java pid= && app/META-INF/.sap_java_buildpack/sap_machine_jdk/bin/jcmd $JAVA_PID VM.start_java_debugging"
```

Open SSH connection to debug process and edit configuration for the debug process in Intellij IDEA:

```bash
cf ssh -N -T -L 8000:localhost:8000 erp
```
